1.1    horatio say ti but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of u therefore i have entreated him along with u to watch the minute of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eye and speak to it

1.1    sit down awhile and let u once again assail your ear that are so fortified against our story what we have two night seen
1.1    well sit we down and let u hear bernardo speak of this

1.1    tis gone and will not answer
1.1    how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you ont
1.1    before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eye
1.1    is it not like the king
1.1    as thou art to thyself such wa the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated so frownd he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange
1.1    thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
1.1    in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state
1.1    good now sit down and tell me he that know why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toil the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implement of war why such impress of shipwright whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night jointlabourer with the day who ist that can inform me
1.1    that can i at least the whisper go so our last king whose image even but now appeard to u was a you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemd him did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his land which he stood seized of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had returnd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher a by the same covenant and carriage of the article designd his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirt of norway here and there sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach int which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of u by strong hand and term compulsatory those foresaid land so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparation the source of this our watch and the chief head of this posthaste and romage in the land
1.1    i think it be no other but een so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that wa and is the question of these war
1.1    a mote it is to trouble the mind eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graf stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman street as star with train of fire and dew of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptunes empire stand was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce event as harbinger preceding still the fate and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countryman but soft behold lo where it come again ill cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirit oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus
1.1    shall i strike at it with my partisan
1.1    do if it will not stand
1.1    tis here
1.1    tis here
1.1    tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is a the air invulnerable and our vain blow malicious mockery
1.1    it wa about to speak when the cock crew
1.1    and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation
1.1    it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season come wherein our saviours birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the night are wholesome then no planet strike no fairy take nor witch hath power to charm so hallowd and so gracious is the time
1.1    so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let u impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to u will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our love fitting our duty
1.1    lets dot i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently
1.2    though yet of hamlet our dear brother death the memory be green and that it u befitted to bear our heart in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen the imperial jointress to this warlike state have we a twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barrd your better wisdom which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with the dream of his advantage he hath not faild to pester u with message importing the surrender of those land lost by his father with all bond of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephew purposeto suppress his further gait herein in that the levy the list and full proportion are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltimand for bearer of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these delated article allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty
1.2    in that and all thing will we show our duty
1.2    we doubt it nothing heartily farewell and now laertes whats the news with you you told u of some suit what ist laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes
1.2    my dread lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thought and wish bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
1.2    have you your father leave what say polonius
1.2    he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seald my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go
1.2    take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best grace spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son
1.2    a little more than kin and le than kind
1.2    how is it that the cloud still hang on you
1.2    not so my lord i am too much i the sun
1.2    good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lid seek for thy noble father in the dust thou knowst ti common all that life must die passing through nature to eternity
1.2    ay madam it is common
1.2    if it be why seems it so particular with thee
1.2    seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suit of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forced breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected havior of the visage together with all form mood shape of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are action that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trapping and the suit of woe
1.2    tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duty to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness ti unmanly grief it show a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschoold for what we know must be and is a common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie ti a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of father and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of u as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no le nobility of love than that which dearest father bear his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
1.2    let not thy mother lose her prayer hamlet i pray thee stay with u go not to wittenberg
1.2    i shall in all my best obey you madam
1.2    why ti a loving and a fair reply be a ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drink today but the great cannon to the cloud shall tell and the king rouse the heaven all bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away
1.2    o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fixd his canon gainst selfslaughter o god god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the us of this world fie ont ah fie ti an unweeded garden that grows to seed thing rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two month dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that wa to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the wind of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think ontfrailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoe were old with which she followd my poor father body like niobe all tearswhy she even she o god a beast that want discourse of reason would have mournd longermarried with my uncle my father brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tear had left the flushing in her galled eye she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheet it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue

1.3    do you doubt that
1.3    for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more
1.3    no more but so
1.3    think it no more for nature crescent doe not grow alone in thews and bulk but a this temple wax the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he love you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weighd his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not a unvalued person do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he say he love you it fit your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark go withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his song or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmasterd importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scape not calumnious stroke the canker gall the infant of the spring too oft before their button be disclosed and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lie in fear youth to itself rebel though none else near

1.3    yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayd for there my blessing with thee and these few precept in thy memory see thou character give thy thought no tongue nor any unproportioned thought his act be thou familiar but by no mean vulgar those friend thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with hoop of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each newhatchd unfledged comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in beart that the opposed may beware of thee give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each man censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit a thy purse can buy but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine ownself be true and it must follow a the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee

1.4    is it a custom
1.4    ay marry ist but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honourd in the breach than the observance this heavyheaded revel east and west makes u traduced and taxd of other nation they clepe u drunkard and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it take from our achievement though performd at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chance in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birthwherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the oergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pale and fort of reason or by some habit that too much oerleavens the form of plausive manner that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature livery or fortune star their virtue elsebe they a pure a grace as infinite a man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of eale doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal
1.4    look my lord it come

2.1    my lord a i wa sewing in my closet lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced no hat upon his head his stocking fould ungarterd and downgyved to his ancle pale a his shirt his knee knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrorshe come before me
2.1    mad for thy love
2.1    my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it
2.1    what said he
2.1    he took me by the wrist and held me hard then go he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus oer his brow he fall to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he let me go and with his head over his shoulder turnd he seemd to find his way without his eye for out o door he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me
2.1    come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and lead the will to desperate undertaking as oft a any passion under heaven that doe afflict our nature i am sorry what have you given him any hard word of late
2.1    no my good lord but a you did command i did repel his fetter and denied his access to me
2.1    that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i feard he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy by heaven it is a proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinion as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love

2.2    a goodly one in which there are many confines ward and dungeon denmark being one o the worst
2.2    we think not so my lord
2.2    why then ti none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking make it so to me it is a prison
2.2    why then your ambition make it one ti too narrow for your mind
2.2    o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dream
2.2    which dream indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
2.2    a dream itself is but a shadow

2.2    what should we say my lord
2.2    why any thing but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your look which your modesty have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you
2.2    to what end my lord
2.2    that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the right of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no
2.2    aside to guildenstern what say you
2.2    nay then i have an eye of youif you love me hold not off
2.2    my lord we were sent for
2.2    i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of latebut wherefore i know notlost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercise and indeed it go so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapour what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animal and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delight not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so
2.2    my lord there wa no such stuff in my thought
2.2    why did you laugh then when i said man delight not me
2.2    to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the player shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service
2.2    he that play the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lung are tickled o the sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt fort what player are they
2.2    even those you were wont to take delight in the tragedian of the city
2.2    how chance it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit wa better both way
2.2    i think their inhibition come by the mean of the late innovation
2.2    do they hold the same estimation they did when i wa in the city are they so followed
2.2    no indeed are they not
2.2    how come it do they grow rusty
2.2    nay their endeavour keep in the wonted pace but there is sir an aery of child little eyas that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped fort these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they call themthat many wearing rapier are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither
2.2    what are they child who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common playersas it is most like if their mean are no bettertheir writer do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession
2.2    faith there ha been much to do on both side and the nation hold it no sin to tarre them to controversy there wa for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuff in the question
2.2    ist possible
2.2    o there ha been much throwing about of brain
2.2    do the boy carry it away
2.2    ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too
2.2    it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mow at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty an hundred ducat apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out
2.2    there are the player
2.2    gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hand come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the player which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my unclefather and auntmother are deceived

2.2    ay so god be wi ye now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wannd tears in his eye distraction in aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with form to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tear and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculty of eye and ear yet i a dull and muddymettled rascal peak like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damnd defeat wa made am i a coward who call me villain break my pate across plucks off my beard and blow it in my face tweaks me by the nose give me the lie i the throat as deep a to the lung who doe me this ha swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeonliverd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kite with this slave offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an as am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murderd prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with word and fall acursing like a very drab a scullion fie upont foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creature sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimd their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ ill have these player play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle ill observe his look ill tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirit abuses me to damn me ill have ground more relative than this the play s the thing wherein ill catch the conscience of the king
3.1    and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he put on this confusion grating so harshly all his day of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy
3.1    he doe confess he feel himself distracted but from what cause he will by no mean speak
3.1    nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keep aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state
3.1    did he receive you well
3.1    most like a gentleman
3.1    but with much forcing of his disposition
3.1    niggard of question but of our demand most free in his reply
3.1    did you assay him to any pastime
3.1    madam it so fell out that certain player we oerraught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and a i think they have already order this night to play before him
3.1    tis most true and he beseechd me to entreat your majesty to hear and see the matter
3.1    with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentleman give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delight
3.1    we shall my lord
3.1    sweet gertrude leave u too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he a twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espial will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him a he is behaved if t be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for
3.1    i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauty be the happy cause of hamlets wildness so shall i hope your virtue will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honour

3.1    o ti too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that help it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burthen
3.1    i hear him coming let withdraw my lord
3.1    to be or not to be that is the question whether ti nobler in the mind to suffer the sling and arrow of outrageous fortune or to take arm against a sea of trouble and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shock that flesh is heir to ti a consummation devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there the rub for in that sleep of death what dream may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give u pause there the respect that make calamity of so long life for who would bear the whip and scorn of time the oppressor wrong the proud man contumely the pang of despised love the law delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy take when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardel bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscoverd country from whose bourn no traveller return puzzle the will and make u rather bear those ill we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience doe make coward of u all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and enterprise of great pith and moment with this regard their current turn awry and lose the name of actionsoft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orison be all my sin rememberd

3.1    that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty
3.1    could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty
3.1    ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this wa sometime a paradox but now the time give it proof i did love you once
3.1    indeed my lord you made me believe so
3.1    you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not
3.1    i wa the more deceived
3.1    get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinner i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such thing that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offence at my beck than i have thought to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellow a i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knave all believe none of u go thy way to a nunnery wheres your father
3.1    at home my lord
3.1    let the door be shut upon him that he may play the fool no where but in own house farewell
3.1    o help him you sweet heaven

3.1    o heavenly power restore him
3.1    i have heard of your painting too well enough god ha given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig you amble and you lisp and nickname gods creature and make your wantonness your ignorance go to ill no more ont it hath made me mad i say we will have no more marriage those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep a they are to a nunnery go
3.1    o what a noble mind is here oerthrown the courtier soldier scholar eye tongue sword the expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form the observed of all observer quite quite down and i of lady most deject and wretched that suckd the honey of his music vow now see that noble and most sovereign reason like sweet bell jangled out of tune and harsh that unmatchd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me to have seen what i have seen see what i see
3.1    love his affection do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lackd form a little was not like madness theres something in his soul oer which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the sea and country different with variable object shall expel this somethingsettled matter in his heart whereon his brain still beating put him thus from fashion of himself what think you ont
3.1    it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell u what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do a you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and ill be placed so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think
3.1    it shall be so madness in great one must not unwatchd go
3.2    speak the speech i pray you a i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it a many of your player do i had a lief the towncrier spoke my line nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and a i may say the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatter to very rag to split the ear of the groundling who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing termagant it outherods herod pray you avoid it
3.2    i warrant your honour
3.2    be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special oerstep not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now wa and is to hold a twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others o there be player that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature journeyman had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably
3.2    i hope we have reformed that indifferently with u sir
3.2    o reform it altogether and let those that play your clown speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectator to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered thats villanous and show a most pitiful ambition in the fool that us it go make you ready how now my lord i will the king hear this piece of work
